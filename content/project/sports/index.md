This project aims to analyze sports through the lens of complexity science.
It focuses on the complex relationships between talent, luck and success, to challenge the winner-takes-all logic that is predominant in reward systems, especially in individual sports based on players' rankings. This is important because we believe that sports are essentially meritocratic, even though we are constantly exposed to successful stories about renowned players and have a sense of luck's role in becoming a top player.
